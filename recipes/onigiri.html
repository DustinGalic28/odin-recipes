        <p>
            Onigiri (Japanese rice balls), are delicious and easy to make. 
            Onigiri is easy to adapt to your own flavour combinations, and are a great way to 
            use up leftover ingredients.
            Onigiri can be enjoyed warm, cold or even at room temperature!

        <h3 class="section-title">Ingredients</h3>
        <ul class="ingredient-list">
            <li>Rice</li>
            <li>Furikake</li>
            <li>Nori</li>
            <li>Any filling you want (Tuna, salmon, tuna & mayo, etc)</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 class="section-title">Steps</h2>
        <ol class="list-steps">
            <li>Pop your cooked rice into a nice mixing bowl. Add the furikake or rice flavouring and mix through evenly. Separate the rice into equal portions, big enough to be a large handful each.</li>
            <li>Wet your hands with water and rub together with a pinch or two of salt. This stops the rice sticking to your hands and helps keep it fresher for longer.</li>
            <li>Take up one portion of rice in your hands.</li>
            <li>If you are hiding some fillings inside, here is where you make an indent, place the ingredients inside and fold the rice over, then lightly press into a ball.</li>
            <li>Using mainly your fingertips while resting the rice on your palm, start to press and squeeze the rice into a triangular shape, rotating as you go so its even.</li>
            <li>Place a slice of nori on the bottom of the onigiri (the rough side should face the rice) and fold it up towards to the middle of the onigiri.</li>
        </ol>
